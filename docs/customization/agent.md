# Rollout and Agentic RL

This guide shows you how to create custom rollout behaviors for RL training by building
a multi-turn math agent with **AReaL-lite**. This agent keeps trying to solve math
problems until it finds the correct answer.

You can find the complete implementation in `areal/workflow/multi_turn.py`.

## Step 1: Define Your Workflow

AReaL-lite gives you flexibility in how you design your agents to run **an episode**.
**An episode** defines how your agent rollouts a complete training sample from an input
prompt, using tools, reward functions, and (multi-turn) generation. Instead of rigid
`Agent` classes that might constrain your agent's capabilities, AReaL-lite captures all
rollout behavior in a `RolloutWorkflow` class. This approach allows you to customize
your agent's behavior however you need.

```python
# areal/api/workflow_api.py
class RolloutWorkflow:
    async def arun_episode(
        self, engine: InferenceEngine, data: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> TensorDict:
        """Run a single episode of the workflow.

        See concrete example implementations under the `areal/workflow` directory.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

The workflow exposes an `arun_episode` method that runs and collects data from a single
episode. This method takes two key arguments:

1. **InferenceEngine**: Provides the `agenerate` method for generating responses to user
   inputs
1. **data**: The prompt data loaded from your RL dataset

Within this method, you have complete control over how your agent and environment
interact.

> **Note**: Each `arun_episode` call takes a single prompt and outputs the trajectories
> generated from that prompt—it's not batched. However, you can generate multiple
> trajectories from a single prompt (for example, with GRPO or tree search).

### Setting Up the Multi-turn Math Workflow

Let's build a multi-turn rollout workflow for solving math problems. First, we'll define
the `__init__` method to set up what we need during rollout:

> **Note**: You have complete flexibility in defining the `__init__` method. Pass
> whatever arguments you need to construct your workflow. If you want to use tools, pass
> the corresponding environment here so your agent can call it in the `arun_episode`
> method.

```python
class MultiTurnWorkflow(RolloutWorkflow):
    def __init__(
        self,
        reward_fn,
        gconfig: GenerationHyperparameters,  # aka sampling_params
        tokenizer: PreTrainedTokenizerFast,
        max_turns: int,
        turn_discount: float,
    ):
        self.reward_fn = reward_fn
        self.gconfig = gconfig
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_turns = max_turns
        # Discount rewards if the agent takes longer to find the correct answer
        self.turn_discount = turn_discount
```

### Implementing the Episode Logic

Now let's implement the `arun_episode` method. We'll start by tokenizing the prompt data
and converting it into an `ModelRequest` object for the inference engine:

```python
class MultiTurnWorkflow(RolloutWorkflow):
    # ... __init__ method above ...

    async def arun_episode(self, engine: InferenceEngine, data) -> TensorDict:
        # Initialize result containers
        seq, logprobs, loss_mask, versions = [], [], [], []
        messages = data["messages"]
        # Run multi-turn rollout until we get the correct answer
        turn_index = 0
        reward = 0
        discount = 1.0
        rid = uuid.uuid4().hex
        while reward == 0 and turn_index < self.max_turns:
            # Convert the conversation into input tokens
            input_ids = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
                messages,
                tokenize=True,
                add_generation_prompt=True,
            )
            # Generate response from the model
            req = ModelRequest(
                rid=rid,
                input_ids=input_ids,
                gconfig=self.gconfig.new(n_samples=1),
            )
            resp = await engine.agenerate(req)
            # ... continue processing ...
```

> **Note**: This example uses the "messages" key from the prompt data to get
> OpenAI-compatible messages. This isn't required—the key and prompt format depend
> entirely on your implementation. For instance, if your dataset stores prompt strings
> in a "prompt" column, you could get input token IDs with
> `self.tokenizer.encode(data["prompt"])`.

> **Note**: The `rid` field in `ModelRequest` is the request ID. Requests with the same ID
> will reuse the LLM inference server's KV caches for better efficiency.

### Handling Multi-turn Conversations

Next, we'll check if the current answer is correct using our `reward_fn`. This function
should return 1 for correct answers and 0 otherwise. When the answer is wrong, we'll
apply a discount, add feedback to the conversation, and let the model try again:

```python
class MultiTurnWorkflow(RolloutWorkflow):
    # ... previous methods ...

    async def arun_episode(self, engine: InferenceEngine, data) -> TensorDict:
        # ... initialization code ...
        while reward == 0 and t < self.max_turns:
            # Add feedback if the previous answer was incorrect
            if t > 0:
                messages += [
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": completions_str},
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": "Your answer is not correct. Please try to answer it again."
                    },
                ]
            # Generate response (code from above)
            # ...
            # Evaluate the response
            prompt_str = self.tokenizer.decode(input_ids)
            completions_str = self.tokenizer.decode(resp.output_tokens)
            reward = self.reward_fn(
                prompt=prompt_str,
                completions=completions_str,
                prompt_ids=resp.input_tokens,
                completion_ids=resp.output_tokens,
                **data,
            )
            # Update counters
            t += 1
            discount *= self.turn_discount
```

### Reward Function Signature

To make it easier to switch between different reward functions, we recommend following
this signature:

```python
def reward_fn(
    prompt: str,
    completions: str,
    prompt_ids: List[int],
    completion_ids: List[int],
    **kwargs,
):
    """Reward function for evaluating agent performance.

    This signature is recommended for compatibility with predefined workflows,
    but you can modify it freely in custom implementations.

    Args:
        prompt: The task description string
        completions: The agent's response string
        prompt_ids: Tokenized prompt
        completion_ids: Tokenized response
        **kwargs: Additional dataset attributes (solutions, input_outputs, etc.)

    Returns:
        float: Reward value (typically 1.0 for correct, 0.0 for incorrect)
    """
```

While this signature is convenient, you're not restricted to it in custom
workflows—modify as needed for your specific use case.

### Collecting Training Data

Finally, let's complete the implementation by collecting trajectories in the
`TensorDict` format:

```python
class MultiTurnWorkflow(RolloutWorkflow):
    # ... previous methods ...

    async def arun_episode(self, engine: InferenceEngine, data) -> TensorDict:
        # ... episode logic above ...

        while reward == 0 and t < self.max_turns:
            # ... generation and evaluation ...

            # Collect trajectory data
            input_len = len(resp.input_tokens) - len(seq)
            seq += resp.input_tokens[-input_len:] + resp.output_tokens
            logprobs += [0.0] * input_len + resp.output_logprobs
            loss_mask += [0] * input_len + [1] * resp.output_len
            versions += [-1] * input_len + resp.output_versions

        # Package results
        res = dict(
            input_ids=torch.tensor(seq),
            logprobs=torch.tensor(logprobs),
            loss_mask=torch.tensor(loss_mask),
            versions=torch.tensor(versions),
            rewards=torch.tensor(float(reward * discount)),
            attention_mask=torch.ones(len(seq), dtype=torch.bool),
        )
        res = {k: v.unsqueeze(0) for k, v in res.items()}
        return concat_padded_tensors([res])
```

> **Important**: The returned `TensorDict` must follow HuggingFace's padded data format,
> where each tensor has shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, *]`. This allows AReaL-lite
> to automatically batch multiple trajectories for training. Since this example returns
> a single trajectory, we use `unsqueeze(0)` to create a batch of size 1.

> **Note**: You're not restricted to specific keys in your `TensorDict`—different
> algorithms need different keys. This example targets the GRPO algorithm, so we include
> `input_ids`, `loss_mask`, `attention_mask`, and `logprobs` (needed for computing
> importance ratios).

## Step 2: Training with Your Custom Workflow

Using your custom workflow is straightforward—just create it in your training script and
pass it to the `rollout_batch` or `prepare_batch` method:

```python
def main(args):
    # ... setup code ...

    # Create your custom workflow
    workflow = MultiTurnWorkflow(
        reward_fn=gsm8k_reward_fn,
        gconfig=config.gconfig,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        turn_discount=0.9,
        max_turns=5,
    )

    # Run training—no other changes needed!
    data_generator = itertools.cycle(train_dataloader)
    for global_step in range(max_steps):
        with stats_tracker.record_timing("rollout"):
            if config.async_training:
                batch = rollout.prepare_batch(train_dataloader, workflow=workflow)
            else:
                batch = rollout.rollout_batch(next(data_generator), workflow=workflow)
        # ... continue with training loop ...
```

That's it! Your custom multi-turn math agent is now ready for reinforcement learning
training. The workflow will automatically handle the multi-turn conversations, reward
computation, and data collection needed for effective RL training.
