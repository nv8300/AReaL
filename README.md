AReaL (Ant Reasoning RL) is an open-source **fully asynchronous reinforcement learning
training system** for large reasoning models developed at **the RL Lab, Ant Research**.
Built upon the open-source project [ReaLHF](https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF),
we are fully committed to open-source by providing training details, data, and
infrastructure required to reproduce results along with the model itself. AReaL aims to
help everyone build their own AI agents easily and affordably. Our team loves milk tea
because it's delicious, customizable, and affordable. We hope you enjoy our project just
like how you enjoy real-world milk tea (cheers).

**AReaL Highlights**

- ‚ö° <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">**\[NEW\] AReaL-lite:**</span> Our new
  release AReaL-lite is a **light-weight** and **algorithm-first** codebase that
  prioritizes better development experiences for AI researchers. As a result, AReaL-lite
  delivers most AReaL functionalities while maintains its high performance with much
  fewer lines of code. This allows users to build their own **agentic** training
  workflows with minimal efforts.
- üî• **Asynchronous RL**: With algorithm-system co-design, AReaL supports fully
  asynchronous RL for **the fastest training speed**! Experimental support for
  multi-turn agentic RL is also provided.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Open & Reproducible**: We continuously release _all code, datasets, and training
  recipes_ for RL training of LLMs.
- üöÄ **Scalability**: AReaL can seamlessly adapt to different computational resource
  settings, ranging from a single node to 1K GPUs.
- üî™ **Cutting-Edge Performance:** AReaL can produce models with cutting-edge reasoning
  capabilities in math and coding. We are also actively working on agentic tasks.

## News

**\[2025/07/31\] (AReaL-lite)** We introduce AReaL-lite, a **light-weight** version of
AReaL designed specifically for AI researchers and rapid prototyping. AReaL-lite
features an **algorithm-first** API design that prioritizes ease of use and algorithm
development, while inherently supporting **fully asynchronous agentic RL**. With 80%
fewer lines of code, AReaL-lite maintains 90% of AReaL's high performance and core
functionality. Check out [our AReaL-lite design doc](/areal/README.md) and
[the quickstart guide](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/tutorial/quickstart.html) to
begin your journey with **AReaL-lite**!

**\[2025/06/03\] (v0.3, boba¬≤)** We release **boba¬≤** (double-boba) for fully
asynchronous RL training, which achieves a **2.77x speedup while obtaining on-par or
even better training performance** compared to synchronous systems. Moreover,
asynchronous RL makes it extremely easy to set up multi-turn agentic RL training! Check
out [our v0.3 overview blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_3.md) and the
[research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24298).

**\[2025/03/31\] (v0.2, boba)** Here comes our next milestone release - boba! Please
call it A-ReaL-boba! This release includes much faster training with SGLang support and
SOTA 7B and 32B models on math reasoning. Check our
[v0.2 technical blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_2.md).

**\[2025/02/24\] (v0.1)** Our initial release includes reproducible results for 1.5B and
7B LRMs. Check our [v0.1 technical blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_1.md).

## AReaL-lite Release Highlights

New highlights in AReaL-lite:

- Instead of the *system-first* architecture in old AReaL, AReaL-lite follows an
  **algorithm-first** API design that aims to provide the following key features:

  - **Light-weight** & **easy-to-write** algorithm and training workflow customization.
  - **Easy to scale up** without knowing system and infrastructure details.
  - **Adaptable and plugable:** Smooth to integrate with other modern AI applications.

  These features make AReaL-lite easy for AI researchers to adopt, understand, and
  develop effectively and efficiently. To learn more about the design principles of
  AReaL, please read the [AReaL-lite design doc](/areal/README.md)!

- A much more *light-weight* codebase compared to old AReaL codebase with only **20%** #
  lines of code, with a detailed
  [code walkthrough](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/lite/gsm8k_grpo.html) on an
  GRPO-on-GSM8K example. Save your time & efforts for code reading!

- Smoother customization for your own **algorithms** and **agentic & RLVR rollout** RL
  within a single file! Check
  [here](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/agent.html) for agent & RLVR
  customization and
  [here](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/algorithm.html) for algorithm
  customization.

Good old stuff from AReaL:

- High performance and scalability with fully asynchronous RL training. Check our
  [boba¬≤ (v0.3) blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_3.md) for details.

- A single command line to launch an experiment, no matter on a single node or a
  large-scale distributed cluster.

Now, let us run an example experiment with AReaL-lite following the quickstart guide
below!

## Getting Started with AReaL-lite

Our training scripts will automatically download the dataset (openai/gsm8k) and model
(Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct). On a single node, runs:

```bash
python3 -m areal.launcher.local \
  examples/lite/gsm8k_grpo.py \
  --config examples/lite/configs/gsm8k_grpo.yaml
```

On a Ray cluster with 2 nodes & 8 GPUs each node, runs (remember to change paths in the
YAML file to your own shared storage):

```bash
python3 -m areal.launcher.ray \
  examples/lite/gsm8k_grpo.py \
  --config examples/lite/configs/gsm8k_grpo.yaml \
  cluster.n_nodes=2 \
  cluster.n_gpus_per_node=8
```

<!-- not finished in this release -->

<!--
Evaluation (on a single node):

```
python3 -m areal.launcher.local examples/lite/eval.py --config examples/lite/configs/eval.yaml
```
-->

For more detailed guide on how to run experiments in AReaL-lite, please check out
[our quickstart guide](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/tutorial/quickstart.html)!

## Switching from legacy AReaL to AReaL-lite

We also provide a convenient script to convert your AReaL YAML config into AReaL-lite
config in one command line. First you need to locate your AReaL config either modified
from files from `examples` folder, or generated when you run your experiments in
`<fileroot>/<expr_name>/<trial_name>` folder. Runs:

```bash
python examples/lite/config_converter.py \
  --convert_src AReaL --src_config_path <path_to_areal_yaml> \
  --template_path examples/lite/configs/gsm8k_grpo.yaml \
  --output_path <output_yaml>
```

Then you should be able to run experiments with your old settings on AReaL-lite!

## AReaL-lite vs legacy AReaL

AReaL-lite is an initiative to fully refactor AReaL, addressing historical issues such
as redundant code and unnecessary system-level abstractions. Currently, AReaL-lite
provides a lightweight codebase that enables fast prototyping for new RL training
workflows and algorithms on a relatively small scale.

For large-scale experiments (1K+ GPUs), we recommend using the battle-tested legacy
AReaL (under directory `./realhf`) to ensure stability. In the future, we will continue
developing AReaL-lite by expanding its APIs, migrating legacy features, introducing new
functionality, and validating the system through large-scale experiments.
